/** This class represents an instruction in DCPU-16 architecture.
  - An instruction in DCPU-16 is 1-3 words long and is fully defined
    by its first word.
    
  - For a BASIC instruction, the lower 5 bits of the first word in the
    instruction is the opcode O, and the remaining 11 bits are splitted
    into a 5-bits value B and a 6-bits value A.
  
  - B is always handled by the processor after A, which is at the lower bits.
 
  - The format of a basic instruction looks like:  AAAAAABBBBBOOOOO.

  - Special instructions have low five bits unset, are constructed as
    AAAAAAOOOOO00000: where AAAAAA is a 6-bits operand and OOOOO is the
    5-bits opcode.
